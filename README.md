# bc-save-editor
The Battle Cats save editor
works for EN and JP saves, simple gui etc etc

ensure that when you are done modding the save that it is patched, this is done by enterting 24 into the gui

if you get an issue trying to spend tickets or use online features, go to the main screen and attempt to upload your save to TBC servers then cancel when it gives you the confirmation codes. If it says "The save has been modified" you have done something bad
